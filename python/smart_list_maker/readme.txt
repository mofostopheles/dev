this is a simple app for data entry of name value pairs. 

think names and email addresses. 

there is a simple UI where you type in your name value pair. 

this get's stuffed into a dictionary. 

if you type a dupe the app silently ignores and continues, not adding the dupe.

every time you add something to the dictionary, the dicctionary is quietly saved to a file.
